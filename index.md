## Course Overview
Data scientists and engineers increasingly have access to a powerful and broad
range of systems they use to conduct big data analysis and machine learning at
scale: from databases, large-scale analytics to distributed machine learning
frameworks. \\
\\
The goal of this class is to provide data scientists and engineers that work
with big data a better understanding of the foundations of how the systems they
will be using are built. It will also give them a better understanding of the
real-world performance, availability and scalability challenges when using and
deploying these systems at scale. In the course we will cover foundational ideas
in designing these systems, while focusing on specific popular systems that
students are likely to encounter at work or when doing research. The class will
include some written homework and programming assignments. One of the
programming assignments will be done in pairs, and the rest will be done
individually. In this course we will answer the following questions:
<ul>
  <li>How are popular big data systems designed and architected?</li>
  <li>How to think about performance, scale and reliability of big data systems?</li>
  <li>How do they remain available and not lose data despite frequent server and
hardware failures?</li>
  <li>How to reason about issues like security, privacy and data quality when
conducting analysis on large data sets?</li>
</ul>

## Prerequisites
Students are expected to have solid programming experience in Python or with an
equivalent programming language. This class is intended to be accessible for
data scientists who do not necessarily have a background in databases, operating
systems or distributed systems.
